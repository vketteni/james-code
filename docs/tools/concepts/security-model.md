# Security Model - Concepts

The James Code system implements a comprehensive multi-layered security framework designed to enable autonomous operation while maintaining strict safety boundaries.

## What the Security Model Does

The security framework provides:

- **Path Validation**: Prevents access outside designated directories
- **Command Filtering**: Controls which commands can be executed
- **Resource Limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion and runaway operations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all security-relevant events
- **Violation Monitoring**: Real-time detection and response to security issues

## Mental Model

Think of security as **concentric protective layers**:

1. **Outer Layer**: Path and directory boundaries
2. **Middle Layer**: Command and operation filtering
3. **Inner Layer**: Resource limits and timeouts
4. **Core Layer**: Audit logging and violation tracking

## Security Principles

### Principle 1: Default Deny
- Operations are blocked by default unless explicitly allowed
- New tools require explicit security review
- Unknown commands are rejected automatically

### Principle 2: Least Privilege
- Tools operate with minimal required permissions
- Each operation is validated independently
- No escalation of privileges during execution

### Principle 3: Defense in Depth
- Multiple independent security layers
- Failure of one layer doesn't compromise overall security
- Each tool implements its own validation

### Principle 4: Transparency
- All security decisions are logged
- Violations are clearly reported
- Audit trail is comprehensive and tamper-evident

## Security Boundaries

### File System Boundaries
```python
# All file operations are restricted to working directory
working_directory = "/safe/workspace"
# ✅ Allowed: /safe/workspace/file.txt
# ❌ Blocked: /safe/workspace/../etc/passwd
# ❌ Blocked: /unsafe/directory/file.txt
```

### Command Execution Boundaries
```python
# Commands are filtered through allow/block lists
allowed_commands = ["python3", "pytest", "git"]
blocked_commands = ["rm", "sudo", "curl", "wget"]
# ✅ Allowed: python3 script.py
# ❌ Blocked: rm -rf /
# ❌ Blocked: sudo apt install malware
```

### Resource Boundaries
```python
# Resource limits prevent exhaustion
limits = {
    "max_file_size": 10 * 1024 * 1024,  # 10MB
    "max_execution_time": 300,          # 5 minutes
    "max_output_size": 1024 * 1024      # 1MB
}
```

## Security Configuration

### Safety Manager Configuration
```python
safety_config = SafetyConfig(
    base_directory="/safe/workspace",
    allowed_commands=["python3", "pytest"],
    blocked_commands=["rm", "sudo", "curl"],
    max_file_size=10 * 1024 * 1024,
    enable_audit_logging=True,
    strict_mode=False
)
```

### Configuration Modes

#### Strict Mode (Production)
- Zero tolerance for security violations
- Immediate termination on violations
- Minimal command set allowed
- Comprehensive logging required

#### Permissive Mode (Development)
- Educational warnings for violations
- Continued operation after non-critical violations
- Broader command set allowed
- Detailed logging for learning

## Security Validation Flow

### Pre-Execution Validation
1. **Path Validation**: Check all file paths are within boundaries
2. **Command Validation**: Verify commands against allow/block lists
3. **Parameter Validation**: Validate all tool parameters
4. **Resource Check**: Ensure operation won't exceed limits

### During Execution
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Track resource usage during execution
2. **Timeout Enforcement**: Terminate long-running operations
3. **Output Monitoring**: Check output size and content
4. **Error Handling**: Secure cleanup on failures

### Post-Execution Audit
1. **Security Event Logging**: Record all security-relevant events
2. **Violation Analysis**: Analyze any security violations
3. **Resource Usage Tracking**: Monitor cumulative resource usage
4. **Audit Report Generation**: Generate security summaries

## Common Security Patterns

### Pattern 1: Secure File Operations
```python
# Always validate paths before file operations
def secure_file_operation(path, operation):
    # 1. Validate path is within working directory
    if not security_manager.validate_path(path):
        raise SecurityError("Path outside working directory")
    
    # 2. Check file size limits
    if operation == "write" and len(content) > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
        raise SecurityError("File size exceeds limit")
    
    # 3. Perform operation with monitoring
    with security_manager.monitor_operation():
        return perform_operation(path, operation)
```

### Pattern 2: Secure Command Execution
```python
# Always filter commands before execution
def secure_command_execution(command):
    # 1. Validate command against filters
    if not security_manager.validate_command(command):
        raise SecurityError("Command not allowed")
    
    # 2. Execute with timeout and monitoring
    with security_manager.execute_with_limits():
        return execute_command(command)
```

### Pattern 3: Audit and Recovery
```python
# Handle security violations gracefully
try:
    result = perform_operation()
except SecurityError as e:
    # 1. Log the violation
    security_manager.log_violation(e)
    
    # 2. Attempt recovery if possible
    if recoverable_violation(e):
        return attempt_recovery()
    else:
        raise  # Re-raise for higher-level handling
```

## Security Monitoring

### Violation Types
- **Path Traversal**: Attempts to access files outside working directory
- **Command Injection**: Attempts to execute unauthorized commands
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Operations exceeding resource limits
- **Parameter Manipulation**: Invalid or malicious parameters

### Monitoring Metrics
- **Violation Count**: Total number of security violations
- **Violation Types**: Breakdown by violation category
- **Resource Usage**: Current and historical resource consumption
- **Operation Success Rate**: Percentage of operations that complete successfully

### Alert Conditions
- **Critical Violations**: Immediate alerts for severe security breaches
- **Repeated Violations**: Patterns indicating potential attacks
- **Resource Thresholds**: Approaching or exceeding resource limits
- **Unusual Patterns**: Deviations from normal operation patterns

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Validate Input
```python
# Validate all inputs before processing
def validate_operation(operation, parameters):
    # Check operation is allowed
    # Validate all parameters
    # Verify resource requirements
    # Return validation result
```

### 2. Use Principle of Least Privilege
```python
# Configure minimal required permissions
safety_config = SafetyConfig(
    allowed_commands=["python3"],  # Only what's needed
    blocked_commands=["rm", "sudo", "curl"],  # Explicitly block dangerous commands
    strict_mode=True  # Strict validation
)
```

### 3. Monitor and Audit Everything
```python
# Log all security-relevant operations
with security_manager.audit_context("file_operation"):
    result = perform_file_operation()
    security_manager.log_operation_result(result)
```

### 4. Handle Violations Gracefully
```python
# Provide clear error messages and recovery options
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SecurityError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Security violation: {e}")
    return safe_fallback_operation()
```

## Threat Mitigation

### Path Traversal Attacks
- **Threat**: `../../../etc/passwd` type attacks
- **Mitigation**: Absolute path resolution and boundary checking
- **Detection**: Path validation before all file operations

### Command Injection
- **Threat**: Malicious commands embedded in parameters
- **Mitigation**: Strict command filtering and parameter sanitization
- **Detection**: Command validation before execution

### Resource Exhaustion
- **Threat**: Operations that consume excessive resources
- **Mitigation**: Timeouts, size limits, and resource monitoring
- **Detection**: Real-time resource usage tracking

### Privilege Escalation
- **Threat**: Attempts to gain higher privileges
- **Mitigation**: Strict command filtering and operation validation
- **Detection**: Monitoring for unauthorized operations

## Configuration Examples

### Development Environment
```python
# Permissive configuration for learning and experimentation
dev_config = SafetyConfig(
    base_directory="./dev_workspace",
    allowed_commands=["python3", "pytest", "git", "ls", "cat"],
    strict_mode=False,
    enable_audit_logging=True
)
```

### Production Environment
```python
# Strict configuration for production use
prod_config = SafetyConfig(
    base_directory="/secure/workspace",
    allowed_commands=["python3"],
    blocked_commands=["rm", "sudo", "curl", "wget", "ssh"],
    strict_mode=True,
    enable_audit_logging=True,
    max_file_size=1024 * 1024  # 1MB limit
)
```

### Educational Environment
```python
# Balanced configuration for teaching and learning
edu_config = SafetyConfig(
    base_directory="./student_workspace",
    allowed_commands=["python3", "pytest", "git"],
    strict_mode=False,
    enable_audit_logging=True,
    max_execution_time=60  # Shorter timeouts
)
```
