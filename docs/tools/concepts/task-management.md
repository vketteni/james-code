# Task Management - Concepts

Task management is the brain of the James Code system, enabling autonomous planning, execution, and progress tracking of complex multi-step operations.

## What Task Management Does

The James Code system provides two complementary tools for task management:

- **TodoTool**: Individual task tracking with rich metadata and hierarchical organization
- **TaskTool**: Intelligent task decomposition and automated execution planning

## Mental Model

Think of task management as **autonomous project coordination**:

1. **Planning Phase**: Break complex requests into manageable steps
2. **Organization Phase**: Structure tasks with dependencies and priorities
3. **Execution Phase**: Systematically work through tasks
4. **Tracking Phase**: Monitor progress and adapt as needed

### The Task Management Hierarchy

│   └── Status management
└── TaskTool (Complex Operations)
    ├── Intelligent decomposition
    ├── Dependency management
    ├── Execution planning
    └── Pattern-based strategies
```

## When to Use Each Tool

### Use TodoTool When:
- **Simple task tracking** - Individual todos and checklists
- **Manual planning** - You know the specific tasks needed
- **Progress monitoring** - Tracking completion of known work
- **Hierarchical organization** - Breaking tasks into subtasks
- **Long-term tracking** - Persistent task lists across sessions

### Use TaskTool When:
- **Complex requests** - Multi-step operations requiring planning
- **Unknown domains** - Working with unfamiliar codebases or projects
- **Automatic planning** - Want the system to figure out the steps
- **Pattern-based work** - Development, analysis, debugging, refactoring
- **Dependency management** - Tasks that must execute in specific order

## Key Task Management Patterns

### Pattern 1: Automatic Decomposition → Manual Refinement
```python
# 1. Let TaskTool decompose the request
task_tool.execute(context, action="decompose_task",
                 description="Implement user authentication system",
                 task_type="development")

# 2. Review and refine with TodoTool
todo_tool.execute(context, action="create_todo",
                 title="Add password strength validation",
                 priority="medium")
```

### Pattern 2: Hierarchical Task Planning
```python
# 1. Create main task
main_task = todo_tool.execute(context, action="create_todo",
                             title="Refactor authentication module",
                             priority="high")

# 2. Add subtasks
todo_tool.execute(context, action="add_subtask",
                 todo_id=main_task.data["id"],
                 subtask_title="Extract password validation logic")
```

### Pattern 3: Progress-Driven Execution
```python
# 1. Get next executable steps
next_steps = task_tool.execute(context, action="get_next_steps",
                              plan_id="plan-123")

# 2. Execute available steps
for step in next_steps.data:
    # Execute the step using appropriate tool
    # Update progress automatically
```

### Pattern 4: Adaptive Planning
```python
# 1. Start with initial decomposition
initial_plan = task_tool.execute(context, action="decompose_task", ...)

# 2. Adapt based on discoveries
if new_requirements_found:
    task_tool.execute(context, action="add_step",
                     plan_id=plan_id, step_data=new_step)
```

## Task Decomposition Strategies

The TaskTool uses intelligent pattern-based decomposition:

### Development Tasks
**Pattern**: Research → Design → Implement → Test
```python
# Automatically generates:
# 1. Research existing codebase and requirements
# 2. Create design plan and architecture
# 3. Implement core functionality
# 4. Test implementation and verify functionality
```

### Analysis Tasks  
**Pattern**: Gather → Analyze → Document
```python
# Automatically generates:
# 1. Gather relevant files and information
# 2. Analyze code content and structure
# 3. Document analysis results and findings
```

### Bug Fix Tasks
**Pattern**: Reproduce → Locate → Fix → Verify
```python
# Automatically generates:
# 1. Reproduce the reported bug
# 2. Locate bug source in codebase
# 3. Implement bug fix
# 4. Verify fix and test for regressions
```

### Refactoring Tasks
**Pattern**: Analyze → Plan → Implement → Test
```python
# Automatically generates:
# 1. Analyze current implementation
# 2. Plan refactoring approach
# 3. Implement refactoring changes
# 4. Test refactored code
```

## Integration Patterns

### With File Operations
Task management guides file operations:

```python
# Task plan includes file operations
{
    "tool_name": "update",
    "tool_params": {
        "action": "replace_pattern",
        "path": "auth.py",
        "pattern": "old_auth_method",
        "replacement": "new_auth_method"
    }
}
```

### With Search and Discovery
Tasks incorporate search strategies:

```python
# Search-based task steps
{
    "tool_name": "find",
    "tool_params": {
        "action": "find_function",
        "function_name": "authenticate",
        "language": "python"
    }
}
```

### With Execution
Tasks can include command execution:

```python
# Execution-based task steps
{
    "tool_name": "execute",
    "tool_params": {
        "command": "python -m pytest tests/test_auth.py"
    }
}
```

## Task State Management

### Todo States
- **pending**: Not yet started
- **in_progress**: Currently being worked on
- **completed**: Successfully finished
- **blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies

### Task Plan States
- **draft**: Plan created but not ready
- **ready**: Plan ready for execution
- **in_progress**: Actively executing steps
- **completed**: All steps finished successfully
- **failed**: Execution failed and cannot continue
- **paused**: Temporarily suspended

## Advanced Task Management

### Dependency Management
```python
# Steps with dependencies
step_1 = {"id": "step_1", "dependencies": []}
step_2 = {"id": "step_2", "dependencies": ["step_1"]}
step_3 = {"id": "step_3", "dependencies": ["step_1", "step_2"]}
```

### Priority-Based Execution
```python
# High-priority tasks execute first
todo_tool.execute(context, action="create_todo",
                 title="Critical security fix",
                 priority="critical")
```

### Time Tracking
```python
# Track estimated vs actual time
todo_tool.execute(context, action="create_todo",
                 title="Implement caching",
                 estimated_hours=4.0)

# Update with actual time
todo_tool.execute(context, action="update_todo",
                 todo_id=todo_id,
                 actual_hours=6.5)
```

### Tag-Based Organization
```python
# Organize tasks with tags
todo_tool.execute(context, action="create_todo",
                 title="Update documentation",
                 tags=["documentation", "maintenance", "low-priority"])
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Automatic Decomposition
Let TaskTool provide initial breakdown, then refine manually.

### 2. Use Hierarchical Organization
Break large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

### 3. Track Dependencies
Ensure tasks execute in proper order by defining dependencies.

### 4. Monitor Progress
Regularly check task status and update as work progresses.

### 5. Adapt Plans
Modify plans as new information emerges during execution.

### 6. Use Appropriate Granularity
Tasks should be small enough to complete but large enough to be meaningful.

## Common Use Cases

### Software Development Projects
1. **Feature Implementation**: Decompose into research, design, code, test
2. **Bug Fixes**: Track from reproduction to verification
3. **Refactoring**: Plan systematic code improvements
4. **Code Reviews**: Create checklists for review tasks

### Code Analysis Projects
1. **Codebase Assessment**: Break into exploration, analysis, reporting
2. **Security Audits**: Systematic checking of security concerns
3. **Performance Analysis**: Profile, identify bottlenecks, optimize
4. **Documentation**: Audit existing docs, identify gaps, create content

### Maintenance Tasks
1. **Dependency Updates**: Check, test, update systematically
2. **Code Cleanup**: Remove dead code, improve formatting
3. **Test Coverage**: Identify gaps, write tests, verify coverage
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep docs current with code changes

### Learning and Exploration
1. **New Codebase**: Systematic exploration and understanding
2. **Technology Research**: Investigate new tools and approaches
3. **Best Practices**: Research and implement coding standards
4. **Architecture Review**: Analyze and improve system design

## Troubleshooting

### Task Planning Issues
- **Vague descriptions**: Provide more specific requirements
- **Too broad**: Break into smaller, focused tasks
- **Missing context**: Include relevant background information

### Execution Problems
- **Dependency loops**: Review and fix circular dependencies
- **Resource conflicts**: Ensure tasks don't conflict with each other
- **Tool limitations**: Verify tasks are within tool capabilities

### Progress Tracking
- **Status not updating**: Check task execution and error handling
- **Lost tasks**: Verify task persistence and file integrity
- **Priority conflicts**: Review and adjust task priorities

### Performance Issues
- **Too many tasks**: Archive completed tasks regularly
- **Complex plans**: Simplify overly complex task decompositions
- **Slow execution**: Profile task execution and optimize bottlenecks
