# 1. Use Architecture Decision Records

Date: 2025-07-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We are building an agentic LLM system that can use READ, WRITE and EXECUTE tools to navigate inside a local user environment. This is a complex system with many architectural decisions to make regarding:

- Agent architecture and orchestration
- Tool system design and safety constraints
- LLM integration patterns
- Security and sandboxing approaches
- Code organization and modularity

We need a way to document these decisions and their rationale for future reference and team alignment.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document important architectural decisions for this project.

ADRs will be stored in `docs/adr/` and follow the format:
- Numbered sequentially (0001, 0002, etc.)
- Include Status, Context, Decision, and Consequences sections
- Use markdown format
- Be immutable once accepted (new ADRs can supersede old ones)

## Consequences

- All major architectural decisions will be documented with clear rationale
- New team members can understand historical context and decisions
- Decision changes will be tracked through new ADRs
- Overhead of maintaining documentation, but improved project clarity
- Enables better decision-making by referencing past decisions and their outcomes
