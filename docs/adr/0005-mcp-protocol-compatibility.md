# 5. MCP Protocol Compatibility

Date: 2025-07-07

## Status

Proposed

## Context

OpenAI's new models support MCP (Model Context Protocol), which standardizes how AI models interact with external tools and resources. This could significantly impact our tool system design.

MCP provides:
- Standardized tool interface definitions
- Resource access patterns (file system, databases, APIs)
- Server-client architecture for tool providers
- JSON-RPC based communication
- Built-in security and capability declarations

Our current design has:
- Custom tool interfaces and registry
- Direct tool execution within the agent process
- Custom security validation
- Tool-specific parameter schemas

## Decision Options

### Option 1: Maintain Current Design
- Keep our custom tool system
- Add MCP adapter layer if needed later
- Full control over tool execution and security

### Option 2: Adopt MCP as Primary Interface
- Redesign tools to implement MCP server interface
- Use MCP client in our agent
- Leverage MCP's standardized security model

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Implement MCP compatibility layer
- Support both native tools and MCP servers
- Gradual migration path

## Recommended Decision: Option 3 (Hybrid Approach)

Implement MCP compatibility while maintaining our current design:

1. **Keep Current Tool System**: Our `Tool` base class and registry remain
2. **Add MCP Adapter**: Create `MCPToolAdapter` that wraps MCP servers
3. **Unified Interface**: Agent sees both as regular tools
4. **Future Migration**: Can gradually move tools to MCP servers

### Implementation Impact

```python
class MCPToolAdapter(Tool):
    def __init__(self, mcp_server_url: str, tool_name: str):
        # Adapt MCP server as Tool interface
        
class ToolRegistry:
    def register_mcp_server(self, server_url: str):
        # Auto-discover and register MCP tools
```

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Future-proof design with MCP compatibility
- Can leverage existing MCP tool ecosystem
- Maintains our current security model
- Gradual adoption path

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity from supporting both interfaces
- Potential performance overhead from MCP communication
- Need to maintain both tool formats

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with current implementation
- Add MCP compatibility layer in next iteration
- Evaluate MCP tool ecosystem as it matures
