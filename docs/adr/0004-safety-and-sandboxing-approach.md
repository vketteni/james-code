# 4. Safety and Sandboxing Approach

Date: 2025-07-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

An agentic system with file system and command execution capabilities poses significant security risks:

- **File System Access**: Potential to read/write sensitive files
- **Command Execution**: Risk of destructive commands or system compromise
- **Path Traversal**: Access to files outside intended directories
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Infinite loops or memory-intensive operations
- **Privilege Escalation**: Potential misuse of system permissions

We need a comprehensive safety framework that balances functionality with security.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered security approach:

### Layer 1: Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Path Validation**: All file paths validated against allowed directories
- **Command Filtering**: Whitelist of safe commands, blacklist of dangerous ones
- **Input Sanitization**: Escape special characters and validate formats
- **Size Limits**: Maximum file sizes, command lengths, and output sizes

### Layer 2: Execution Constraints

- **Working Directory Restriction**: All operations confined to project directory
- **Timeout Limits**: Commands automatically terminated after time limits
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU usage constraints
- **User Permissions**: Run with minimal required privileges

### Layer 3: Monitoring and Auditing

- **Operation Logging**: All tool usage logged with timestamps
- **Error Tracking**: Security violations and failed attempts logged
- **Usage Metrics**: Track resource consumption and patterns
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain history of all file system modifications

### Implementation Strategy

```python
class SafetyManager:
    def __init__(self, base_dir: str, config: SafetyConfig):
        self.base_dir = Path(base_dir).resolve()
        self.config = config
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    
    def validate_path(self, path: str) -> bool:
        # Ensure path is within base directory
        
    def validate_command(self, command: str) -> bool:
        # Check against whitelist/blacklist
        
    def execute_with_limits(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        # Apply timeouts and resource limits
```

### Configuration Options

- **Sandbox Mode**: Strict vs. permissive modes
- **Allowed Directories**: Configurable base directories
- **Command Whitelist**: User-configurable safe commands
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable timeouts and memory limits
- **Logging Level**: Configurable audit detail level

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Multiple layers of protection against security risks
- Configurable security levels for different use cases
- Comprehensive audit trail for security analysis
- Prevents most common attack vectors

**Negative:**
- Performance overhead from validation and monitoring
- Complexity in configuration and maintenance
- Potential false positives blocking legitimate operations
- May limit functionality in some scenarios

**Risks:**
- Security bypasses if validation logic has bugs
- Performance degradation from excessive checking
- User frustration from overly restrictive policies
