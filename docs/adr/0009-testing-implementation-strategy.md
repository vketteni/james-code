# 9. Testing Strategy

Date: 2025-07-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

James Code requires comprehensive testing for:
- **Security**: File system and command execution risks
- **Complexity**: Multi-component architecture  
- **Autonomy**: Independent decision-making system

## Decision

Implement continuous testing with focus on:

### Core Testing Areas
- **Unit Tests**: Individual tool functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Tool interactions and workflows
- **Security Tests**: Command validation and path restrictions
- **Real Scenarios**: End-to-end user workflows

### Testing Tools
- pytest for test framework
- Mock LLM for predictable testing
- Security test vectors for safety validation
- Performance benchmarks for optimization

### Implementation Approach
- Write tests continuously alongside development
- Focus on security-critical areas first
- Use existing fixtures and mocks where possible
- Maintain >80% code coverage

## Benefits
- **Security confidence**: Validated safety constraints
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive scenario coverage
- **Maintainability**: Tests as documentation
- **Performance**: Benchmarking and optimization

## Success Criteria
- All tools have comprehensive test coverage
- Security vulnerabilities are caught by tests
- Real-world scenarios execute successfully
- Performance meets established benchmarks
