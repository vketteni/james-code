# 2. Agent Architecture Design

Date: 2025-07-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to design the core architecture for an agentic system that can:
- Use READ, WRITE, and EXECUTE tools to navigate a local environment
- Maintain conversation context and planning state
- Execute multi-step tasks autonomously
- Integrate with various LLM providers
- Provide safety constraints and sandboxing

Key architectural considerations:
- Tool abstraction and extensibility
- LLM provider abstraction
- State management for multi-step operations
- Error handling and recovery
- Security and sandboxing boundaries

## Decision

We will implement a modular agent architecture with the following components:

### Core Components

1. **Agent**: Main orchestrator that manages conversation flow and task execution
2. **ToolRegistry**: Registry pattern for managing available tools
3. **LLMProvider**: Abstraction for different LLM backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
4. **ExecutionContext**: Manages state, working directory, and environment
5. **SafetyManager**: Enforces security constraints and sandboxing

### Architecture Pattern

```
Agent
├── LLMProvider (abstraction)
├── ToolRegistry
│   ├── ReadTool
│   ├── WriteTool
│   └── ExecuteTool
├── ExecutionContext
└── SafetyManager
```

### Implementation Language

Python will be used for the core implementation due to:
- Rich ecosystem for LLM integration
- Strong tooling for file system operations
- Excellent libraries for subprocess management
- Good security primitives for sandboxing

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Extensible tool system
- Multiple LLM provider support
- Centralized safety management
- Testable components

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity from abstractions
- Potential performance overhead from multiple layers
- Need to maintain multiple interfaces

**Risks:**
- Security vulnerabilities if SafetyManager is not properly implemented
- Complexity in state management for long-running operations
