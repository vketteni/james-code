# 6. Additional Fundamental Tools

Date: 2025-07-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our current tool set (READ, WRITE, EXECUTE) provides basic file system and command execution capabilities. However, for a truly robust agentic system, we may be missing several fundamental tools that enable more sophisticated autonomous behavior:

### Missing Tool Categories

1. **UPDATE Tool**: Surgical file modifications
   - Apply patches/diffs to files
   - Update specific lines or sections
   - Merge changes without overwriting
   - Handle edit conflicts

2. **TODO Tool**: Task management and planning
   - Create and manage task lists
   - Track progress and dependencies
   - Break down complex operations
   - Maintain context across sessions

3. **TASK Tool**: Task decomposition and orchestration
   - Decompose complex requests into steps
   - Create execution plans
   - Manage task dependencies
   - Coordinate multi-step operations

4. **FIND Tool**: Advanced search capabilities
   - Find files by name patterns
   - Search content within files
   - Locate code patterns/functions
   - Navigate large codebases efficiently

### Current Limitations

- **WRITE tool** can only overwrite entire files (not surgical edits)
- **No built-in planning** or task management capabilities
- **No sophisticated search** beyond basic directory listing
- **No task decomposition** for complex operations

## Decision

We will implement these additional fundamental tools to create a more robust agentic system:

### 1. UPDATE Tool
```python
class UpdateTool(Tool):
    # update_lines(file, start_line, end_line, new_content)
    # apply_patch(file, patch_content)
    # replace_pattern(file, pattern, replacement)
    # insert_at_line(file, line_number, content)
```

### 2. TODO Tool
```python
class TodoTool(Tool):
    # create_todo(title, description, priority)
    # list_todos(filter_by_status)
    # update_todo(todo_id, status)
    # add_subtask(parent_id, subtask)
```

### 3. TASK Tool
```python
class TaskTool(Tool):
    # decompose_task(description, context)
    # create_plan(task_list, dependencies)
    # execute_plan(plan_id)
    # track_progress(plan_id)
```

### 4. FIND Tool
```python
class FindTool(Tool):
    # find_files(pattern, directory)
    # search_content(query, file_types)
    # find_function(name, language)
    # grep_recursive(pattern, directory)
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **FIND Tool** (High) - Essential for code navigation
2. **UPDATE Tool** (High) - Critical for surgical edits
3. **TODO Tool** (Medium) - Important for task management
4. **TASK Tool** (Medium) - Useful for complex operations

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- More sophisticated autonomous behavior
- Better code navigation and editing
- Built-in task management and planning
- Reduced need for external tools

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity and attack surface
- More tools to secure and validate
- Potential overlap with existing tools

**Integration:**
- All tools will use the same security framework
- Consistent with existing tool interface
- Same path validation and resource limits
