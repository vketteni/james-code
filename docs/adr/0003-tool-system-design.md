# 3. Tool System Design

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The agentic system needs a robust tool system that provides READ, WRITE, and EXECUTE capabilities while maintaining security and extensibility. Key requirements:

- **READ**: File system navigation, content reading, directory listing
- **WRITE**: File creation, modification, deletion
- **EXECUTE**: Command execution with output capture
- **Security**: Sandboxing, path validation, command filtering
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new tools
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with informative messages

## Decision

We will implement a tool system with the following design:

### Tool Interface

```python
class Tool:
    def __init__(self, name: str, description: str):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
    
    def execute(self, context: ExecutionContext, **kwargs) -> ToolResult:
        raise NotImplementedError
    
    def validate_input(self, **kwargs) -> bool:
        raise NotImplementedError
```

### Core Tools

1. **ReadTool**
   - `read_file(path)`: Read file contents
   - `list_directory(path)`: List directory contents
   - `file_exists(path)`: Check file existence
   - `get_file_info(path)`: Get file metadata

2. **WriteTool**
   - `write_file(path, content)`: Write/overwrite file
   - `append_file(path, content)`: Append to file
   - `create_directory(path)`: Create directory
   - `delete_file(path)`: Delete file

3. **ExecuteTool**
   - `execute_command(command, cwd=None)`: Execute shell command
   - `execute_with_timeout(command, timeout)`: Execute with timeout
   - Support for environment variables and working directory

### Security Constraints

- **Path Validation**: All paths must be within allowed directories
- **Command Filtering**: Whitelist/blacklist for dangerous commands
- **Resource Limits**: Timeout and memory limits for execution
- **Sandboxing**: Optional chroot/container isolation

### Tool Result Format

```python
@dataclass
class ToolResult:
    success: bool
    data: Any
    error: Optional[str] = None
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear separation between tool types
- Consistent interface for all tools
- Built-in security validation
- Extensible for future tools
- Structured error handling

**Negative:**
- Overhead from validation and abstraction
- Potential performance impact from security checks
- Complexity in implementing sandboxing

**Risks:**
- Security vulnerabilities if validation is bypassed
- Path traversal attacks if not properly secured
- Command injection through execute tool
